## Introduction
Designborne is a role-playing game inspired by popular titles such as Dark Souls, Elden Ring, and Bloodborne. The game aims to provide a challenging and immersive experience by leveraging concepts and mechanics from these renowned games while incorporating unique features tailored to our game engine and objectives.

## Game Overview
In Designborne, players take on the role of "The Abstracted One," a character revived in an abandoned village. As they navigate through various environments, players will encounter enemies, collect items, and enhance their abilities. The game emphasizes strategic combat, exploration, and resource management, requiring players to make tactical decisions to survive and progress.

Use the options displayed in the game menu to move, pick up items, and attack enemies.

## Key Features
- **Player Character**: Start with 150 hit points and 200 stamina. Players can attack enemies with limbs or pick up and use weapons like the Broadsword.

- **NPC Interactions**: Interact with characters like the blacksmith and a suspicious traveler to upgrade and trade items.

## Design Principles
Designborne is developed with a focus on object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, ensuring a maintainable, scalable, and flexible codebase. Key principles include:

- **SOLID Principles**: The game architecture follows the SOLID principles to create a robust and modular system. Each class has a single responsibility, dependencies are injected to promote loose coupling, and interfaces are used to define clear contracts between components.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Code redundancy is minimized by abstracting common functionality into reusable methods and classes. This approach enhances code readability and maintainability.

## Achievements
Through the development of Designborne, the team has achieved the following:
- Created a complex game environment with interactive elements and strategic combat mechanics.
- Implemented a comprehensive item and skill system that adds depth and variety to gameplay.
- Ensured code quality and maintainability by adhering to OOP principles and best practices.
- Developed a dynamic and engaging player experience inspired by beloved action RPGs.

## Conclusion
Designborne is a testament to the power of combining classic game design with modern programming practices. By focusing on solid architectural principles and a compelling gameplay experience, the project showcases the team's ability to create an intricate and enjoyable game world.
